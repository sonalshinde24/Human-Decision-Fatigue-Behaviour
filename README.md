# Human-Decision-Fatigue-Behaviour 🧠📊

A data analysis and prediction project focused on understanding and modeling human decision fatigue behaviour using the Human Decision Fatigue Behavioral Dataset.

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (human-decision-fatigue-prediction.ipynb) that explores patterns in the human decision process and attempts to build predictive insights.

---

### 📎 Dataset

The project uses the Human Decision Fatigue Behavioral Dataset from Kaggle.

### 🔗 Dataset link:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sonalshinde123/human-decision-fatigue-behavioral-dataset

This dataset contains behavioral, cognitive, and lifestyle variables collected from individuals that may contribute to decision fatigue. It includes features such as hours awake, number of decisions made, average decision time, and other relevant indicators.

---

### 🧠 Project Overview

This project aims to:

✔ Load and explore the human decision fatigue dataset  
✔ Clean and preprocess the data  
✔ Visualize decision fatigue patterns and trends  
✔ Build and evaluate predictive models for aspects related to decision fatigue  
✔ Derive insights about behaviour patterns that indicate decision fatigue

### 📚 About Decision Fatigue (Context)

Decision fatigue is the decline in the quality of decisions after long sessions of decision making a psychological effect where mental resources become depleted after continuous choice making.

The dataset and analysis in this project relate to this behavioral pattern, enabling data-driven exploration of decision fatigue.
